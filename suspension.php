                        Your vehicles suspension has two key roles, making sure your vehicle holds the road properly and provide
                        a comfortable ride for you and your passengers. If your suspension is not working properly it will not only be
                        uncomfortable, but it can also be dangerous.

                            The suspension is responsible for ensuring that there is adequate friction between your cars tires
                            and the road. If a suspension is failing and there is not enough friction on the road your vehicle
                            will be much more susceptible to hydroplaning and veering - both with can have deadly outcomes.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Don't just assume, make sure your suspension is functioning as it should.
