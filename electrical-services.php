                            There are many different things that could be going on with your vehicle's electrical systems, but there are a few tell-tale signs that you can learn to spot to be sure. Having a dead battery
                            might be the easiest to identify. If your car won't start, your headlights are dim or won't come on at all, and the interior lights are also off, you could have a dead battery.
                         </p>

                            If it appears you do have some power coming in but when you try to start the car it seems to struggle with turning it over, your battery may not be storing enough electricity. Check our
                            availability for our
                            fast and affordable <a href="/contact/?serv=battery">battery service and replacement</a>.

                            Batteries and alternators aren't the only type of electrical issues that could keep your vehicle sidelined. Sometimes it could be something as simple as a loose or damaged spark plug, old electrical
                            fuses, or issues with your starter. Regular <a href="/tuneup/">vehicle tune ups</a> with Muffler &amp; Go can keep your electrical systems running smooth and help prevent more serious and expensive
